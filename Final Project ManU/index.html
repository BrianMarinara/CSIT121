<h6>History continues to be written</h6>
<p4>Manchester United first gained promotion into the top division in 1892. From there they have become arguably the biggest football club in the world. All across the globe you will find Manchester United jerseys being worn. Club legends such as George Best, Bobby Charlton, Ryan Giggs, Sir Alex Ferguson, Wayne Rooney, Christiano Ronaldo and countless others have always brought the spotlight on this club. We have experienced the lowest of lows with the Munich Air Disaster and the highest of highs such as the treble in 1999. Today our biggest challenge is the owners. We the fans continue to fight for a chance to rid this club of the current regime and return our club to its rightful place as the best club in the world.</p4>

  <h7>My love for Manchester United</h7>
    <p5>This club has been a huge part of my life since I graduated high school in 2013. All of my friends were big fans of other teams and that started my love of the sport. Something about Manchester United just resinated with me. The history, the stadium, even the mascot. I have witnessed this club play some of the worst football you could possibly imagine. I have also watched them shock the world with comebacks that seemed impossible. I do everything I can to not miss a game and I show my love through social media and wearing the badge whenever I can. I will always be a Red Devil.</p5>
