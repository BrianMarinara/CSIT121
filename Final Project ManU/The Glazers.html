  <h1>The Glazers</h1>

<p>The Glazers and Manchester United have had a rough relationship since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. In 2005 the Glazers were able to take over full ownership of Manchester United. This was done on the back of many loans that the club is still feeling the effects of today. Sir Alex was able to cover up a lot of the issues happening behind the scenes. The Glazers see Manchester United as a business commodity rather than a football club. The training grounds, stadium, and overall facilities have completely fallen behind the times with them in charge. The debt number has grown to over 500 million under this regime. Post Sir Alex showed all of us the issues that have been growing behind the scenes. We now see protests at every single game against this ownership. Green and gold is the colors worn in these protests. The growing pressure from fans seems to finally be making some traction as we expect the Glazers to sell in the near future. The only problem now is how much time and money will be needed in order to restore the glory of this wonderful club.</p>
