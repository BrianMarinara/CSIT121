	 		<p>Rice has been a staple of almost every dinner we have for a long time now. My girlfirend's grandfather
	 			forgets that he buys thing off QVC. Well he ended up with 3 rice cookers. We were gifted one of those
	 		rice cookers after this was discovered. Out of all the appliances in our house this rice cooker is used the most hands down</p>
