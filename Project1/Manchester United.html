	 		<p>The first year I started following soccer was 2013. Manchester United wasn't actually the first team I started following.
	 			I was a huge fan of a German team named Bayern Munich. But as time went on, the more popular Premier League was starting to 
	 			catch my eye. All my friends had already chosen the teams they cheered for. Manchester United however was not one of the
	 			teams. My favorite color is red and they are called the "Red Devils" so it only seemed fitting. My love for that team has grown
	 		every year I continue to watch. The goal is to see them play live one day.</p>
