	<h1>XML and JavaScript Introduction</h1>
	<h2>What is XML?</h2>
	<p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used to encode documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. This is mainly used for communication between different systems.</p>
	<h2>How is XML used?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Storing and exchanging data between different applications and platforms</li>
		<li>Configuring and customizing software applications</li>
		<li>Defining document structures and schemas</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>What does XML look like? (provide an example)</h2>
	<p>Here is an example of an XML document:</p>

	<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
	<p>JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to code different applications on the web. It is an essential component of web development. </p>
	<h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
	<p>HTML provides the structure and content of web pages, while CSS is used to style and format them. JavaScript is used to add functionality to web pages. JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, and it can also be used to communicate with web servers.</p>
	<h2>What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions?</h2>
	<p>JavaScript elements are the basic building blocks of a script. An example would be "for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++)". Properties include name, age, height to provide characteristics. Methods 
		are called to perform an action. For example, person.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John." This would output a message we code. Functions are code that can be called upon with different arguments. function addNumbers(x, y) { return x + y;. </p>
