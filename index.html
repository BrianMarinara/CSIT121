			Hello, my name is Brian Marana. I am 27 years old and currently working in the electrical field. I attend CCBC online and have been working towards
			an IT degree. One of my courses focuses on HTML, hence the reason why this website is here. I have created this webpage to show my 3 favorite things in 
			the world. I have done that by creating HTML pages for each section as well as a CSS page helping to create the design.</p>
