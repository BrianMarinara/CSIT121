<p>Growing up I was not a fan of vegetables at all. My house was a mash potatoes and corn enviroment. I have expanded my pallet as I've gotten older and discovered a love for brussel sprouts.
The asian flavors pair great with the brussel sprouts and I make these as a side quite often.</p>
<h4><strong>Your cooking guide</strong></h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 400&deg;F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slightly oil the paper and set it aside.</li>
		<li>Trim brussel sprouts in halves and set in a large mixing bowl and pour oil on top. Stir to evenly cover all halves.</li>
		<li>Place the brussel sprouts in your baking sheet and make sure they do not touch each other.</li>
		<li>Bake for 15 minutes. Stir halfway and keep roasting for 10-15 minutes until crispy outside and tender inside.</li>
	</ol>
<h5><strong>Asian Sauce</strong></h5>
	<ol>
		<li>In a non-stick saucepan, combine all the ingredients we've yet to use but use minimal sugar. Whisk to combine and dissolve cornstarch into the mix.</li>
		<li>Bring over medium-high high, until it simmers and thickens. Stir once in a while. Taste test and add sugar if a more sweeter sauce is desired.</li>
		<li>Remove roasted brussel sprouts from the oven and place them into a serving dish. Pour the warm sticky sauce on top and mix.</li>
		<li>Serve with a pinch of chili flakes and sesame seeds on top.</li>
	</ol>
