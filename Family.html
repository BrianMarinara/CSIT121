	 		<p>I am currently living with my girlfriend of 8 years, our cat, and our bearded dragon. I have changed a lot over the 
	 			course of 8 years and I am happy with where we are in life at this moment. Our cat Socrates is 5 years old and he 
	 			is like most cats, temperamental. Our bearded dragon Nameless is 6 years old. His favorite activity is sleeping so 
	 			he is living the good life because he gets plenty. Then there is me and my girlfriend Courtney. We have been together
	 			8 years and I love being able to travel different places with her. At the end of a long day this is a pretty great
	 		little family to come home too.</p>
